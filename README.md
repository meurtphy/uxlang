Stage 1 Report ‚Äì Portfolio Project
0. Team Formation
Team Members Introduction
Our team consists of two members:

Enzo: currently changing careers; brings resilience and organizational skills to the team.

Erwan: also changing careers; stands out for his creativity and wide-ranging interests.
